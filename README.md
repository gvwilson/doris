# doris: a minimal dashboard engine

This project shows learners how to build a dashboard creator like [Dash][dash]
([Schroeder2022](b:Schroeder2022))
using [Flask][flask],
[htpy][htpy],
[Polars][polars],
and [Chart.xkcd][chartxkcd].
Along the way,
it introduces a bit of JavaScript
and shows how to test web applications.

## Learner Persona

-   Sabina, 28, has a master's degree in animal physiology
    and now works for a mid-sized veterinary pharmaceutical company.
-   She learned a bit of R in an undergraduate biostatistics course,
    then picked up Python in grad school.
    She spends several hours a week analyzing data
    and visualizing it with [Plotly Express][plotly-express],
    and is comfortable with basic Git commands.
-   Sabina recently became responsible for maintaining a dashboard application built with [Dash][dash].
    She believes a better understanding of how web applications work
    will help her debug and extend it.
-   English is Sabina's second language,
    and she sometimes feels left out when people use slang or programming jargon.
